3 day project


I made this project to be a python recreation of the original game Mine Sweeper.
The graphical interface was made by myself using an online graphics package "graphics.py"
I didn't make graphics.py



**How to play**
When initialized, there will be a large 20x20 grid.
To start, click anywhere on this grid to reveal your cave.
The white tiles represent the cave coordinates that dont have any surrounding bombs.
The gray number tiles represent spaces with at least one bomb in one of the surrounding spaces.
Your job is to explore the whole grid and flagging the bombs.
To flag a bomb, press the place flag button in the top-right, and click the suspected bomb location.
